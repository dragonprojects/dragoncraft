<!-- 

These are the built-in capacitor definitions. You cannot change this file, it is a
reference for you only and will be generated every time the game starts.

To make changes to the capacitor definitions, copy the capacitors you want to change to
a file in the 'user' folder.

You can also disable all built-in recipes with the setting "loadCoreRecipes"
in the Ender IO config file, so that only your files in the 'user' folder will
be loaded. Please be advised that all capacitor definitions are absolutely needed,
so you will have to copy those over into a 'user' file for the game to load.

More information on the syntax can be found in the recipes.xsd file. An
XML editor will display that as tooltips when editing this file.
